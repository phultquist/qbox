```python
SpringCoefficient = -1
Damping = -5
ElectromagneticStrength = 1


For 1 == 1
  InputSignal = LowPass(frequency: 200hz, slope: 2nd order or 12db/octave) of (Imported Computer Audio Signal Stream)
  TotalSignal = ElectromagneticStrength * TotalSignal + Damping * Integral(Total Signal) + SpringCoefficient * Integral^2(Total Signal)
  
  Return CorrectedSignal
```
