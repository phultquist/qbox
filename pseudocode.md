```python
#By the way, all Constants are to be determined.

SpringCoefficient = -1
#Driver Spring Coefficient

Damping = -5
#Driver Damping Coefficient

ElectromagneticStrength = 1
#Input Signal Electromagnetic force strength / signal gain

CompensationP = 1
CompensationI = 1
CompensationD = 1
#PID parameters for Corrective pid loop

For 1 == 1
#There is probably a better way to do this I just wanted to make it clear that this is a forever repeating loop.

  InputSignal = LowPass(frequency: 200hz, slope: 2nd order or 12db/octave) of (Imported Audio Signal Stream)
#Importing current audio data and applying a lowpass filter to the signal

  TotalSignal = ElectromagneticStrength * TotalSignal + Damping * Integral(Total Signal) + SpringCoefficient * Integral^2(Total Signal) +   CompensationP * (InputSignal - TotalSignal) + CompensationI * Integral(InputSignal - TotalSignal) + CompensationI * Derivative(InputSignal - TotalSignal)
#TotalSignal represents the total force on the driver at all times, which is ideally equal to InputSignal. The terms with ElectromagneticStrength, Damping, and SpringCoefficient represent the forces that create the resonant properties of the driver. The "Compensation" terms are the agressive, corrective PID loop that attempts to force TotalSignal to equal InputSignal. I assumed that you would know the most efficient way to calculate derivatives and integrals of a data stream, so I didn't try to approximate them.
  
  Return (Input Signal + CompensationP * (InputSignal - TotalSignal) + CompensationI * Integral(InputSignal - TotalSignal) + CompensationI * Derivative(InputSignal - TotalSignal))
#Finally, the InputSignal plus the corrective factors are returned.
